# Security Policy

> **Note:** This project is not being actively maintained due to time constraints. Security issues will be addressed as time permits, but responses may be delayed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL] with details. While I will do my best to respond as quickly as possible, please note that response times may be extended due to limited maintenance availability.

Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been addressed.
