## üöÄ Deployment

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of Regex Builder:

```sh
pnpm build
```

This will generate an optimized Next.js build.

### Running Production Build Locally

To test the production build locally:

```sh
pnpm start
```

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js application is with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the platform from the creators of Next.js:

```sh
pnpm add -g vercel
vercel
```

#### Option 2: Traditional Hosting

For deploying to traditional hosting environments:

1. Build your application:
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```
2. Start the Next.js production server:
   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

#### Option 3: Static Export

If you want to export your Next.js application as static HTML:

1. Configure `next.config.js`:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     output: 'export',
     // ...other config
   }
   ```
2. Build your application:
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```
   
This will export static HTML to the `out` directory, which can be deployed to any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or S3.
